# Vibma

**Vibe Design meets Figma.** Let AI agents design directly in Figma — read layouts, create components, modify styles, and build entire design systems through conversation.

<!-- TODO: demo video -->

## Setup

For manual setup or if you care about what's running on your machine, follow the [full setup guide](./DRAGME.md).

Otherwise, paste this to your AI agent and let it figure it out:

```
Set up Vibma so I can vibe-design in Figma.
Follow the instructions at https://github.com/ufira-ai/vibma/blob/main/DRAGME.md
```

Good luck vibing.

Vibma is the first open-source project from **[ufira](https://github.com/ufira-ai)** — a platform bridging creators and technology. We believe every creator should have access to AI-powered design tools, not just developers.
